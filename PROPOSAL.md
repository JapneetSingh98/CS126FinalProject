# Project Proposal
My idea was to create a gravity simulator
This allows the user to place particles on the screen with the mass and initial velocity of their choosing. 
The user is also able to adjust the gravitational constant and can put down pre-made patterns of particles. 


I was thinking about using openFrameworks, ofxGui, and ofxButtons
