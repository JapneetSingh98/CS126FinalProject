# Project Proposal
My idea was to create a gravity simulator
This allows the user to place particles on the screen with the mass and initial velocity of their choosing. 
The user will also be able to choose the mass of the particles that will be placed.

I was thinking about using openFrameworks, ofxGui, and ofxButtons

Bonus features:
The user is also able to adjust the gravitational constant and can put down pre-made patterns of particles. 
Sun and Damppen buttons allow the user to add a "sun" to the field and play around with "friction"
Particles change color based on their velocity
Visibility mode that makes objects appear bigger (usefull for visually impaired users or for presentations where particles may appear too small)
