General timeline of project:

• Nov 15
  - Created particle class that contains particle information such as location, forces, mass, and velocity.
  - For next time:
    • allow users to place particles onto screen
    
• Nov 22
  - Enabled user to place particles on the board using mouse location. 
  - Gave particles initial velocity.
  - Figured out how to give universal gravitational field.(used for practice and not in final product)
  - Added in the neccessary equations and functions that allow particles to be attracted to one another. 
  - For next time:
    • fix bug that causes pairs of particles to fly off in vertical or horizontal direction

• Dec 5
  - Added in code that would create an invisible "sun at the center of the screen.
  - Added in velocity damppening code.
  - Fixed bug that caused pairs of particles to fly off
  - For next time:
    • begin adding buttons that allow user to pick particle mass

• Dec 6
  - Started adding visual elements (not part of initial plan):
    • number of particles in field
    • color of particle shifts with velocity
  - For next time:
    • find button addon

• Dec 12
  - Found ofxButtons
  - Added on screen buttons for user interface (same purpose as key-presses)
  - Wrote code that removes particles once they go a certain distance from the center of the screen
  - Added code that creates pre-set patterns of 100 particles:
    • grid
    • random position & velocity
  - Added GUI slider to allow user to adjust gravitational constant. 
  - Adjusted pre-set masses to make project better.
